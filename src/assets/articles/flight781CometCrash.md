### Summary

The Comet was a luxury flight for people travelling during the 1950s. At the time, there were less than 20 or so operating in the world. On January 10 1954, one of the Comets (Flight 781) exploded in the air, killing all 35 people onboard.

The Comet was a new type of aircraft from British Airways and was a new technology that people were looking forward to. It could fly twice as fast as the usual commercial jets at the time, and achieved this by flying higher altitudes and in thinner air. 

There was a structural problem in the Comets that caused 3 Comets to crash within a 12 month timespan. This flight, Flight 781, was the second one that crashed.  

Supports around parts of the aircraft (such as windows, etc) were not glued together the way they should have been. A technique called 'Punch riveting' was used instead to drill parts together. The punches that were made were imperfect, causing defects/cracks. The cracks extended all around and within the skin of the aircraft.

Everytime the aircraft was used, the cabin/plane needed to be pressurised. During this process, parts of the aircraft like the wings were stressed, and caused a certain level of fatigue. This is a normal process as the amount of pressurisation cycles determines the lifespan of the aircraft. 

On Flight 781, the normal pressurisation process of the cabin led to extreme metal fatigue due to the defects, cracks and holes caused by the punch riveting. Overtime, a large crack around 2cm wide finally formed. 

On this particular flight, the large crack led to the skin of the aircraft being ripped off mid-flight, causing explosive decompression. The aircraft split into multiple pieces and fell into the sea near Elba Island, off the Italian coast. All 35 people onboard were killed.

Among the dead was a man who was about to get married to his fiancee in 2 weeks. He had bought a wedding dress to surprise her with. This was found in the wreckage.
