### Summary 

Past Facebook/Youtube/Twitter employees are interviewed and they explain the powers and dangers of Social Media. They explain how users are manipulated and purposely tricked into staying on the screen for the longest possible time by using AI and selling our 'attention' to advertisers. As mentioned repeatedly, "we are the product being sold." The documentary has a strong focus on the exploitation and manipulation of users for financial gain through surveillance capitalism and data mining.

[The Social Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Dilemma)

The documentary explores the societal and emotional impacts that the rise in technology has on society. This includes the serious mental health issues that social media networks like Facebook contribute to, especially in young and impressionable teenagers and young adults. The psychological effects that sites like Facebook have on the brain are very dangerous to young people. It has the potential to enforces insecurity by causing people to compare themselves with others. 

Relationships issues can also occur. People spend hours a day on their phone without even realising it, therefore wasting precious time that could be spent making actual relationships and connections. When someone breaks up with an ex, relationship stalking can occur, or ex-partners also have the potential to destroy the reputation of the other if the person is unable to 'get over' their ex. 

People put filters in order to cover how they really look. It also trains the brain to focus strongly on what other people think about them through the constant releases of endorphins when likes or attention are receieved. Since the rise of social media, there have been direct correlations to the rise in suicide rates as well. 

It is emphasized that decisions that impact billions of people are made by only a small group of engineers.
