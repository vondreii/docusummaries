### Summary 

The Challenger Space Shuttle happened on January 28, 1986. During take off, the space shuttle exploded and broke apart, killing everyone onboard (7 people).

The launch was a big event that was going to 'revive public interest in the space program.' With the space program having multiple budget cuts in the 1980s, this was very a very important event but did even more damage when the spacecraft exploded.

Many people streamed in to watch the live TV broadcast of the event, and crowds of people visited the site in person. 7 astronauts were scheduled to take part in the Shuttle Challenger program. These included several 'everyday people' who were trained so that they would be able to withstand the strong G-forces. One of the passengers was a teacher (Christa McAuliffe) who wanted to go on the Challenger to get children excited about education. There was also a mother, another 'everyday citizen'.

The failure was caused by the failure of O-ring seals. During take-off, the O-rings are meant to 'seal' or close a gap at the moment of ignition when gas is created, to stop the gas from getting through to the rest of the shuttle. However, temperatures on this particular take-off were extremely cold so the O-rings failed, and allowing pressurized burning gas to spread to the rest of the shuttle. This hot burning gas eventually moved to the location of the fuel tanks and other flammable objects, ultimately resulting in the explosion.
