The building is called the Begich Towers, and has everything a town would have - a post office, schools, jobs, gym, etc. It sits surrounded by mountains behind the building. Infront of the building there is a harbour and nice view of the lake.

Anyone can get to Whittier by boat/ship, train, plane, or by driving through a long tunnel (the second-longest highway tunnel in North America).
