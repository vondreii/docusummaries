### Summary 

Grizzly man is about the life and death of Timothy Treadwell. He lived an alternative lifestyle, mostly with bears, out in the Alaskan winderness during Summer months. On his final visit he took his girlfriend, Amie Huguenard, and at some point during the trip they were killed and eaten by a grizzly bear on October 6, 2003.

Over 100 hours of footage was found from his camera, which had the last 5 years of his life. The footage showed many moments where he would talk to himself or directly to the camera, mostly with bears walking in the background. With his interactions with the camera he would think out loud or express deep thoughts that he had.

Treadwell said he was protecting bears from poachers, however it was later stated that there were no records of poaches in the area he was in. Treadwell became so close to the bears that he could touch them, pet them, or talk to them at close range.

Park rangers shared multiple opinions on Treadwell's close contact with the bears. One of them express that Treadwell's close and direct contact with them possibly confused them. Others stated that is possibly put bears in more danger, because bears started familiarising themselves with human contact, making it more likely for them to approach other humans.

Treadwell usually left the park at the end of summer but that particular year her stayed into early October. This put him and Huguenard at greater risk, as in this period, bears are more aggressive about searching for food to store up calories for hibernation during the winter. 

Sometime in October 2003, Treadwell was camping with Amie, when a bear approached, and the video camera captured an audio record of the bear attack. 

The attack and killings took place in camp the night before Willy Fulton (the pilot) flew in to pick Tim and Amie up. When the bear was found and killed by park rangers, four garbage bags containing human remains were removed and flown out by helicopter.
