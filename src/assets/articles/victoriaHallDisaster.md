An advert was out for ticket to see 'The Fays,' an act of entertainers who travelled around to give shows to kids. Kids bought the tickets and went to see the show with their friends. There were very little adult supervision, and the crowd was made up of mostly children aged 8-11 or 13. There was an estimated 1,100 children in the theatre.

At the end of the show, an announcement was made that children with certain numbered tickets would be presented with a prize upon exit. The Fays were only throwing treats and toys to the bottom half of the crowd. The kids sitting in the upper level of the theatre didn't want to miss out on the treats, so many of them started running for the side staircase where they could get downstairs.

At the bottom of the staircase, the door opened inward and had been bolted so as to leave a gap only wide enough for one child to pass at a time. Children started tripping and falling at this door, and children started piling up ontop of each other. Many of the children died of suffocation, or were crushed to death by the weight of the crowd behind them.

When the adults in the auditorium realised what was happening they rushed to the door, but they could not open it fully as the bolt was on the children's side (it was not an outward-swinging door). Adults had to take children out from behind, from the end of the stampede, meaning rescue came too late for the ones already trapped.

They started laying out the kids on the ground, one by one, lined up, and parents had to go and see if their children were dead among the line of children. Some parents lost all children in the tragedy.
