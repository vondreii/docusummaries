Kitty was 16 or 17 years old when she had to enter the camp, in 1943. She survived there for 2 years. While at Auschwitz, they found jobs here and there to help keep them alive. They did less physically-demanding jobs, made connections or tried to use the jobs they had to their advantage.

When the camp was liberated in 1945, Kitty and her mother found that all of their other family members had been killed. They moved to England, and Kitty started opening up about her story and spreading awareness about what happened inside Auschwitz.
