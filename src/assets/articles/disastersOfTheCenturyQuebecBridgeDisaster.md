August 29, 1907, the bridge collapsed for the first time. Preliminary calculations made early in the planning stages were never properly checked, and the carrying capacity was not enough to support itself. There was a point in the middle of the bridge that started bending due to the weight, which was noticed by some of the workers. Theodore Cooper, a consulting engineer first reported that the issue was minor. Finally he agreed to send a telegraph to the Phoenix Bridge Company: "Add no more load to the bridge till after due consideration of facts."

The message, however, was not passed to Quebec in time. Just as the day was finishing, the south arm along with some of the middle sections of the bridge collapsed into the St. Lawrence River. The whole collapse took under 15 seconds. 75 workers were killed and many others were injured.

On September 11, 1916, the bridge collapsed for the second time. The bridge was fully constructed except for the middle piece, which needed to be placed in the water under the bridge and slowly raised into place. However, while the middle part of the bridge was being lifted, it suddenly fell back into the water, killing 13 workers. 

On August 1919, the bridge construction was finally successful, at a total cost of $23 million and 88 bridgeworkers' lives. The Quebec Bridge is still standing today.
