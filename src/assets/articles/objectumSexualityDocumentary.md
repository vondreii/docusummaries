One of the notable people that were interviewed included a lady who used to have a bow/arrow as her boyfriend. Her and the bow used to complete in many competitions together. However, she broke up with her bow as she realised she had fallen in love with the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. She could no longer compete with her bow at events anymore because she said it was difficult to do those activities while always being around her ex-boyfriend. She was also married to the Eiffel Tower. Another lady was in love with a particular theme park ride, and would visit it in order to make love to it.
