A man wearing a Blue boiler suit descending into a manhole near the Picadilly line escalator. 2 minutes later, a passenger noticed that there was a flickering/glowing light underneath the escalator. A small fire then started developing on the escalator, which seemed to be coming from underneath it. 

10 minutes after the fire was discovered, passengers started being evacuated via the Victoria Line escalator, which runs parrallel to the Picadilly line escalator. Both escalators emerge at the ticket gate/hall area above.

All of a sudden, the small escalator fire erupted into a massive fire (as if it exploded or made contact with something flammable). The fire spread to engulf the entire Picadilly line escalator, as well as the landing at the top, near the ticket gates. Many people were engulfed in the flames and died.

The people who were still on other platforms acted quickly to flag passing trains down, and to get on them and ride away from the station. 

When the fire ended, an investigation concluded that it was caused by a passenger who was smoking, and threw a match which was not correctly put out. The match fell through the gaps of the escalator and ignited (the escalators were wooden).
