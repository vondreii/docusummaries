The race had many important car companies participating in it (Ferrari, Jaguar, and Mercedes-Benz).

The race began at 4pm, and the crash happened a few hours after the race started, at 6:26pm. This was when the racers were starting to make their first pit stops. 4 cars were involved in the incident (Jaguar, Austin-Healey and 2 Mercedes):

- Jaguar - Mike Hawthorn

- Austin-Healey - Lance Macklin

- Mercedes 1 - Pierre Levegh

- Mercedes 2 - Juan Manuel Fangio

Hawthorne (Jaguar) was infront, and put his brakes so he could exit the track and go into one of the pit stops to refill fuel and stuff. He broke too hard, causing the driver behind him, Macklin (Austin-Healey) to brake hard as well. Macklin swerved to the left to avoid Hawthorne.

Macklin ended up swerving infront of another car, driven by Levegh (Mercedes 1). Levegh (Mercedes 1) smashed into Macklin, and Macklin's car acted as a ramp that caused Levegh's car to fly up and directly into the crowd of people who were watching.

Before Levegh crashed into Macklin, Levegh put his hand up to avoid the fourth driver behind him, Fangio (Mercedes 2), so he could avoid the crash, potentially saving his life.

When Levegh's car flew into the audience, it was at such high speed that the car split into 3 parts, the front engine, the hood and the front axles. The debris flew and cut down/rolled over 80 metres of the audience. The hood flew across the audience, decapitating the ones in it's path. The Mercedes' body was partially made of a magnesium alloy, so when it was in flames, putting water over it made more bursts of hotter flames, which killed more people.

Levegh was thrown out of the car and died on impact, he was burnt and lying on the ground and his wife watched the whole thing from exactly across the track, and she was completely inconsolable.

Around 84 people were killed, and more than 100+ were injured, however this number is different depending on sources, some people put deaths as high as 130+.
