During World War 2, people used the Bethnal Green Tube (train station) as shelter from Air Raids in London. On one particular air raid drill, many people made their way to the tunnel. One person tripped towards the bottom, sending many other people tumbling over each. 300 people were caught in the struggle.

Those who were trapped found it hard to breathe. Eventually, 170 people either suffocated or were crushed to death, and 60 people were taking to hospital. This incident is thought to have been the largest single loss of civilian life in the UK in the Second World War and the largest loss of life in a single incident on the London Underground network.
