### Summary 

This documentary film shows a different side to the multi billion dollar Psychiatric industry. Multiple Psychiatrists are interviewed, with them stating that there are no known cures for any of the mental illnesses, and the internal workings of psychotropics drugs are not fully understood despite them being distributed to millions of patients worldwide.

According to the film, modern day anti psychotropics do not have a very consistent success rate. Many patients must keep changing medications without any sign of getting better. Some patients genuinely believe that they are getting better through the 'placebo effect' as there is no hard evidence to show a chemical imbalance, or how these medicines can treat the chemical imbalance. The chemical imbalance has never even been fully proven, however phychiatrists still continue to use it as if it is true.

The film emphasises that these are extremely dangerous drugs, and you also can't stop taking them straight away. Some instances of doing this can cause health issues or can cause the person to become violent.

Almost half a million people die per year from these medicines, and they cause side effects such as:

- Being anxious
- Feeling depressed
- Severe weight gain
- Psychosis
- Brain damage
- Stiff muscles
- Restless movement
- Heart problems
- Makes them into a zombie/vegetable state
- Cannot be out in the sun for too long
- Burning eyelids
- Tardive dyskinesia (eg tongue twisting on its own)
- Sudden death
- Cardiac arrest
- Being dizzy, vomiting, feeling sick
- Loss of concentration
- Loss of sleep, or sleep too heavy
- The strong feeling of being very 'out of it' or an 'out-of-body' feeling
- Shrinking of the brain
- Almost every other disease or illness in the book

Some of these side effects can be permanent and some can be temporary. The film emphasises on the point that you wouldn't want to treat certain illness with drugs that cause those same illnesses (and more) as side effects (for example, treating anxiety with a drug that has anxiety as a side effect)

These dangerous medicines are distributed to children, and the age is always decreasing. A notable patient included a 10 year old was given these medicines and gained 40 kg. The film emphasises that something needs to change as corruption exist in this industry on many levels.
