A loud sound was recorded on the cockpit voice recorder when the explodion happened. Debris fell from the sky, and a wing section hit the house, exploding. Many houses on Sherwood Crescent were destroyed with falling debris or by the following fires. 

2 weeks before the plane exploded, the Helsinki warning occurred. The US Embassy in Helsinki, Finland received a call from a man with an Arabic accent. He stated, in advance, that within the next 2 weeks, a Finnish woman will unknowingly carry a bomb planted by someone associated with the Abu Nidal Organization onto a Pan Am flight, flying from Frankfurt to the United States, which would blow up the plane.

In 2001, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, a Libyan intelligence officer, was jailed for life after being found guilty of 270 counts of murder in connection with the bombing. In 2003, Gaddafi accepted responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing and paid compensation to the families of the victims, although he maintained that he had never given the order for the attack.
