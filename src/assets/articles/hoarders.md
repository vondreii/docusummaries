Notable episodes:

- **Pumpkin Lady** - A lady who found it difficult to stop hoarding food. She had many rotten pumpkins on the ground, as well as expired food in her fridge. The hoarding had become so intense that the bottom of her fridge started to accumulate a black liquid, and her fly traps (that had not been changed) were filled with tens or possibly hundreds of flies.

- **21-year-old hoarder** - This episode featured an unemployed 21 year old who lived with his alcoholic father. His father was unable to clean up the many leftover bottles from his alcohol consumption, and the 21 year old also found it difficult to clean up after himself. All the rubbish had accumulated in his room and throughout the house.

- **Cat Lady** - There was a lady who kept lots of cats in her house. She didn't know the exact number, though she estimated close to 20 cats. When the cleanup crew started cleaning her house, they found more than 30 dead cats and kittens scattered throughout the attic, the garage, the living room and kitchen. Many of the kittens and cats who died were crushed under the rubbish and furniture. In total there were more than 40 cats and kittens (alive or dead) found throughout the house. 9 of the cats who were rescued had to be put down because they were suffering under the extreme conditions.
