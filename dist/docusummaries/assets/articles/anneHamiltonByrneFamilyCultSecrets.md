### Summary 

In the 1960s-1970s, Anne Hamilton-Byrne acquired 14 children, deceived them into thinking that she was the biological mother and isolating them from the world through a cult that she called "The Family". 

Anne forced the children to do many strange activities within the cult. The group's headquarters was raided by the police on 14 August 1987 and all children were removed from the premises.

Prior to "The Family", Anne was the organiser of another cult-like religion called Santiniketan. Marion Villimek, a Santiniketan member, owned and managed the Newhaven Psychiatric Hospital which was run by Santiniketan psychiatrists. At the hospital they administered large quantities of LSD and used electroconvulsive therapy, causing at least one patient's death.

When the Newhaven Psychiatric Hospital closed down, Anne and her psychiatrists started "The Family." Netween 1968 and 1975, Anne acquired 14 infants and young children. Some had been obtained through irregular adoptions that were organised from members within Santiniketan in order to bypass the normal legal adoption processes. Identities of the children were changed through fake documents. Many of their features were 'forced' such as dyed blonde hair to make it look like they were related.    

The children were home schooled on a private property. They were told that Anne was their biological mother even though this was mostly not the case. They were isolated from the rest of the world, beaten and starved. The children were frequently dosed with psychiatric drugs or LSD. While under the influence of the drug the child would be left in a dark room, alone.

Sarah Hamilton-Byrne was expelled by Anne and later spoke to police, resulting in raid on the property. She was fined substantially.
