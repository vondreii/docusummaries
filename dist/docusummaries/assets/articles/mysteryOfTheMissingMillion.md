Thousands of people in Japan identify as Hikikomori, meaning they are living a recluse life, shut in from the rest of society. These include grown adults who either still live with their parents (and are not employed, or in education or training), or live alone in a small apartment that is paid for by another person (usually a family member such as a parent).

The documentary film visits some of the houses of the Hikikomori, with some of the parents being interviewed about how it has impacted their living situation. In many cases, the parents are older and still working in order to support both themselves and their grown son or daughter. Some of the Hikikomori themselves are also interviewed. 

Reintegration centers exist to help with the Hikikomori. These include classes or short training courses that run infrequently (once or twice a month) to help the Hikikomori slowly get out into the world without initiating too much of a culture shock.
One of the Hikikomori in the film was successfully able to reintegrate back into society, and dedicated part of her time to raise awareness of the Hikikomori through magazine publications.
