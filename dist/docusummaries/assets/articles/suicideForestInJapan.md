Aokigahara is considered a popular tourist destination. However the forest is extremely deep in some parts, and despite many people visiting it on a regular basis, many people who go to commit suicide are never found. This is because they usually go deep into the forest to hang themselves. Some of the forest trails are full of signs attempting to turn some people around, and change their mind. The forest is also rumoured to have supernatural things going on in it due to the spirits of so many people were mentally and emotionally not in a good place when they died.
