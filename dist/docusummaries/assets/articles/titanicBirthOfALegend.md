Titanic was 269.06m long. Her total height, from the base to the top of the bridge, was 32m. he construction involved many layers:

- **Boat Deck** - The deck where lifeboats were kept. This was where the lifeboats were lowered into the North Atlantic during the early hours of 15 April, 1912.

- **A Deck -** reserved exclusively for First Class passengers and contained First Class cabins, the First Class lounge, smoke room, reading and writing rooms and Palm Court.

- **B Deck**, the **Bridge Deck** - which housed more First Class passengers, and held some restaurants and luxury dining facilities for First Class passengers.

- **C Deck**, the **Shelter Deck**, for third class passengers, and the Second Class library.

- **D Deck**, the **Saloon Deck**, also for third class passengers.

- **E Deck**, the **Upper Deck**, also for third class passengers plus berths for cooks, seamen, stewards and [trimmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_trimmer).

- **F Deck**, the **Middle Deck**, was the last complete deck and mainly accommodated Second and Third Class passengers as well as some of the crew. It housed the Third Class dining saloon, a swimming pool, Turkish bath and kennels.

- **G Deck**, the **Lower Deck**, was the lowest complete deck that carried passengers, and had the lowest portholes, just above the waterline. Food was also stored here. The deck was interrupted at several points by [orlop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlop) (partial) decks over the boiler, engine and turbine rooms.

- The **Orlop Decks** and the **Tank Top** below that were on the lowest level of the ship, below the waterline. These decks were used as cargo spaces, while the Tank Top part of the ship's hull kept the ship's boilers, engines, turbines and electrical generators, which passengers were prohibited from seeing.

The ship was constructed in Belfast Harbour (Northern Ireland) next to its sister ship, the Olympic. 246 injuries were recorded, 28 of them "severe", such as arms severed by machines or legs crushed under falling pieces of steel. Altogether, there were six deaths on the ship while it was being constructed and fitted out, and another two deaths in the shipyard workshops and sheds. Just before the launch a worker was killed when a piece of wood fell on him.
