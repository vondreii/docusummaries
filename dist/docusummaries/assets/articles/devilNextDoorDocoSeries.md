Ivan the Terrible was a German Nazi guard who worked in the Nazi Concentration (Death) Camp Treblinka during the Holocaust in WW2. Ivan the Terrible was known to torture victims before putting them into the gas chambers.

A public trial for his involvement (crimes against humanity etc) was televised and lasted for about a year, and included lots of testimonies from survivors and some documented evidence such as ID cards or US immigration documents. 

He was found Guilty. However new evidence was able to identify Ivan the Terrible as someone else, named Ivan Marchenko. During the re-trial or appeal, John Demjanjuk was found innocent by reasonable doubt.

After a few years this was investigated further and it was found that even though John Demjanjuk was not Ivan the Terrible, he was still a Nazi Guard who served in a different camp, at Sobibor. He was convicted and found guilty of almost 30,000 counts of murder and sentenced to 5 years in prison, when he was 91.
