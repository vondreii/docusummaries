Two young backpackers met Roman Heinze (61 years old) during a hiking trip, through the Gumtree website. They went with him under the assumption he would give them a lift to Melbourne. However, Heinze drove them to a rural area on a sandy beach at Salt Creek.

He then proceeded to attack the two, and sexually assaulted them. One of them ran and was able to escape in an attempt to find some help. This left the second women with the man, who she fought hard with to stay alive. In order to keep distance between herself and Heinze, she stayed ontop of Heinze's truck so that he couldn't get a hold of her. He attempted to drive erratically around the sand drunes in order to get her to fall off.

Eventually, the first woman who escaped was able to find a group of Australian men who agreed to help her find Heinze and the girl, who they were able to rescue.

Heinze was sentence to a total of 22 years and four months for the attack.
