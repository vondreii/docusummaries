Henri was the youngest of the Van Breda family. They were originally from Australia, and lived in Australia for many years until 2014 when some of the family relocated to a well secured neighbourhood in South Africa. Some of the family stayed in Australia for reasons such as needing to complete their university degree.

In 2015, Henri attacked all the members in the household with an axe, giving them all very serious injuries. He axed both his parents, his older brother (22) and younger sister (16). He then called his girlfriend, who missed his call. 

A few hours later he called the local authorities, saying that "An intruder attacked my family with an axe."

A lot of the evidence pointed to Henri, especially with how there was no forced entry, and it was a very secure neighbourhood. He did not sustain any axe injuries. He had self-inflicted injuries that was superficial to make it look like he was also a victim. His DNA was also found at certain points in the crime scene, which suggested that he was involved in the murders. He was sentenced to three life terms, fifteen years for attempted murder on his sister, and twelve months for obstruction of justice.
