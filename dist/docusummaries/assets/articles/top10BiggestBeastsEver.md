The 10 animals are:

- **10: The largest insect to ever live.** It was called the Meganeuropsis permiana, which was a large Griffinfly (dragonfly). A researcher at a University was trying to investigate why insects were so big millions of years ago. He concluded that it was possibly because the earth had more oxygen at the time, which effected them in a way where they were able to grow larger.

- **9: The largest flying bird ever.** Pelagornis sandersi had a wing span the length of a 2-lane highway or a fighter jet. It was as big as birds could ever get, and they could only fly by gliding from a high altitude (as how a paraglider works) and using the wind's direction to stay in the air.

- **8: The largest walking land mammel.** The Paraceratherium stood more than 2 storeys tall and weighed 20 tonnes (20,000 kg). It looked like a cross between a giraffe and an elephant. It was as long as a battle tank and much larger than the African Elephant.

- **7: The largest flying dinosaur.** The Pterosaur was the height of a giraffe and had extremely large wings. It had long tendons that could act as catapults/crossbows, allowing them to pull back and crossbow into the sky in order to start flying.

- **6: The largest snake.** The Titanoboa is a snake the length of a school bus. It squeezes it's prey at a pressure that's almost 100psi.

- **5: Large Ocean Killer.** Pliosaurus is one of the largest ocean killer that's 50 feet long. It has 4 fins and uses them to swim quickly to catch its prey.

- **4: Biggest Land Predator.** Spinosaurus - a dinosaur that had claws almost as big as a human arm (which could slice you with one motion). It was the size of a firetruck and had a fin at the top of its back. It is theorized that it could walk on its front 2 claws (on all 4 legs), and swim. It could feed on both land and sea animals. It had holes on it's large snout so that it could sense and kill animals through camouflage and senses the same way an alligator catches their prey.

- **3: Largest Shark Ever.** The Megalodon was 100 times heavier than a Great White Shark. The baby Megaladon was the size of a normal adult sized Great White.

- **2: The largest sea animal.** The Blue Whale eats giant packs of krill (with thousands of krill) at the same time. They also manouver in a way where they don't have to exert as many calories while they hunt for their food.

- **1: Largest Animal.** The Titanosaur stood over 3 storeys tall, weighed as much as 11 T-rexes, and was the length of the space shuttle orbiter. One foot was big enough to crush 20 people.
