### Summary 

Supersize Me is a documentary film that follows Morgan Spurlock for a period of 30 days. Spurlock goes on a challenge to eat nothing but McDonalds for all meals of the day (breakfast, lunch and dinner). He kept track of his progress by regularly visiting doctors and health experts who continuously measured his weight/body fat/cholesterol.

Morgan was generally fit before starting the challenge. He was assessed by doctors who found him to have good cholesterol/sugar levels and a good body fat percentage. 

The rules of the challenge included:

- Cannot have anything but McDonalds.
- Must eat all meals, breakfast, lunch and dinner.
- If they ask if he wants to supersize the meal, he must say 'Yes'.

After a few days Spurlock started feeling physically sick, as he was used to mostly eating home food. His cholesterol and sugar levels spiked, along with weight gain. In one of the scenes, he is shown trying to finish a McDonalds meal, only to throw it up over the side of his car.

At some point along his journey, he actually lost weight. This was because he had lost muscle mass, which was replaced with fat (which weighs less than muscle). 

About midway through, he started feeling depressed. He was not getting the right amount of nutrients and he was starting to get 'addicted' to the food, where he would only feel happy when he was eating. They had to stop the experiment between 20-30 days, because the doctors found it too dangerous to continue.
