### Summary 

This documentary film follows the lives of various people who live by the minimalism lifestyle. Many of the people in the film live a more extreme life of minimalism, including living in extremely small houses that only have a single main living space.

However, one does not need to live this way in order to become a minimalist. Minimalism is about owning only the things you need, or only owning things that add value to your life - not necessarily about restricting too much. Many items may seem useless (like fake plants) but they can still be kept if they add value to your life, or the overall environment.

There are many advantages of living life as a minimalist. In many ways, it can prevent someone from getting into debt by paying for things that they don't need with money that they don't have. Many people have too many things that they never really use (eg many shoes, handbags, even having more cars than needed), which clutters the house. Having a cluttered or full house or having many re-financed cars repayments can sometimes indirectly/directly lead to higher levels of worrying/being stressed.

By decluttering things you don't need and only keeping what you do need/value, you will find it easier to look for things as everything can be grouped (eg, having a single hardware drawer/area, having a single drawer/area to store stationary).

In many ways, minimalism can free our minds to focus on the things that really matter, rather than focus on being too materialistic.
