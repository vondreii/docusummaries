It is uncovered how Saudi Arabia is a very restrictive country, and if you hold any idea that is not seen as 'correct' you could be executed on the street or sentenced to jail. It is shown to be very similar to the dictatorship that is present in North Korea.

One young man who made Youtube videos spreading freedom messages was sentenced to a certain number of whippings and 10+ years in a Saudi Arabia prison.

Women are also not allowed to do many things without a man being present. They are not allowed to drive, and if someone abuses them on the street, they must have a man with them present in order to file a complaint.

Police brutality is shown to also be very common, with police openly shooting and killing protestors.

Hidden cameras caught many things during their visit:

- Many people were living in poverty (such as in slums), similar to the poverty experienced in third world country slums like in India or The Philippines.

- The inside of prisons were overcrowded with hundreds of people lying next to each other on the cement ground.

- Frequent executions and whippings. People were being sentenced to death and hung high where everyone could see them (like on cranes, where multiple people are hanging at once).

The undercover journalists were frequently stopped by the police due to suspicions.

The film shows that many of the officials are rich in Saudi. This is especially because of the amount of oil that can be found in that region and the amount of deals that have happened between Saudi, the UK and the US.
