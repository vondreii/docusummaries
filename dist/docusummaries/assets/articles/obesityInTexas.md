Various reasons are explored as to why this is the case. Some of the major factors of this include:

- Cheap food along with large servings.
- Irresistible deals. "Finish this whole meal and you can get it for free."
- Many individuals choose to eat out more often (sometimes, all 7 days a week).
- Texas is spread over such a large area, forcing most people to drive.
- Schools also have unhealthy meals, contributing to childhood obesity.

There are varying opinions about the obesity epidemic in Texas. While some are not considering weight loss anytime soon, others were not aware of the issue due to lack of nutritional education. One women explained how she felt it was completely normal to see obese people everywhere as she grew up with it. Since she never saw a problem with her weight, she therefore did nothing about it. Other characters include:

- A 34 year old women, who felt like she missed out on a lot of her younger years because of her weight. She decided to get weight loss surgery to help with her weight loss goals.
- One of the men, who ate out 7 days a week, and said he was fine with his weight. Large meals were cheap to buy and would usually come with a deal (for example, if he was able to finish all the food under a time limit, the meal would be free).
- A child who weighed the size of an adult. He claimed his friend could eat twice as much as him because he had a 'faster metabolism.' However his friend disputed this by saying that he actually eats more, and sometimes finishes other people's meals.
- A women who weighed 620 pounds (281.227 kg) with a BMI of over 100. She needed a helper to assist her with everyday activities. She explained how she wanted people to accept her for who she was without having to lose weight. According to her, she was the prettiest in her family.

The importance of nutritional education is emphasized as extremely important in helping tackle obesity, starting from a young age. This includes changing the food that is served in cafeterias at schools.
