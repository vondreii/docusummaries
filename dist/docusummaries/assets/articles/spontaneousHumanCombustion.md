### Summary 

Spontaneous human combustion is a phenomenon where people can spontaneously catch fire without an obvious cause and die. The fire rarely affects surroundings and usually dies down on its own. Sometimes only the person's torso was on fire, leaving the limbs in tact.

Some causes point to the habits of the victims, for example, many of the victims smoked or drank alcohol which might have contributed to the ignition. They were also usually surrounded by other sources of ignition (candles, etc) which didn't seem to cause, contribute or join the fire that was inside the person. In many cases, both the hands and feet fall off or the limbs are not burnt along with the torso. 

Common characteristics of all the victims include:

1. Being chronic alcoholics;
2. Being elderly females;
3. Having a lighted substance come into contact with the person; 

One theory is that people don't actually 'spontaneously combust' but they fall asleep holding their cigarettes which burns their clothes, chars it and causes a 'wax' effect where the fire eventually dies out after burning through the person. This was proven in experiments, but it is unsure if it can explain all cases.
