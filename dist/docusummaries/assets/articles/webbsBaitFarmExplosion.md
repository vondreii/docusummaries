The farm itself grew and manufactured worms and other fishing bait and sold fishing equipment. The owner of the farm was Dan Lee Webb, aged 30 at the time of the disaster. He worked with his family (mother, brother, uncle, wife) and friends who he employed on the farm.

The farm was losing money, so Howard Emmett Bramblett suggested to Dan to start manufacturing M-80 and M-100 fireworks, which are banned by federal laws. Dan then worked on the fireworks manufacturing with his family and friends. They started mixing chemicals and explosives in order to create the Fireworks, and the barn now had a chemical mixing area.

On May 27, 1983, at approximately 9:15 AM, eleven workers were on duty when a cache of M-80 and M-100 explosives, flash powder, and other chemicals in the barn detonated, producing a powerful explosion and instantly killing all eleven workers and leveling the barn. 

Dan Lee Webb's cousin Tommy Webb, who was mowing the grass near the site, was reported to have been thrown more than 70 yards. The force of the blast shattered windows in several homes and other structures on nearby properties.

Parts of bodies were hurled through the roofs of the nearby house and carport. Nothing in the barn was left intact; all of the bodies had lost limbs and six were decapitated. Some were stripped by the force of the blast. 

Dan Lee Webb was not there at the time of the explosion. People who died included Dan Lee Webb's mother, uncle, brother and many of his friends and their children. Dan Lee Webb surrendered to the police two days later and was charged with eleven counts of involuntary manslaughter and illegally manufacturing and possessing explosives. He pleaded guilty and sentenced to 10 years.

20 other people were convicted and charge as a whole illegal fireworks operation/distribution was uncovered by police.
