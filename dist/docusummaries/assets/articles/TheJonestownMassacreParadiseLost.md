### Summary

Jim Jones was the founder and leader of a cult known as the 'Peoples Temple', located in Jonestown, Guyana. Jim Jones chose a remote and isolated place on which to create a settlment to lead, isolate and manipulate his followers. On the 18th November, 1978, during a 'White Night', Jim Jones led everyone in the town out of their beds and into the dark (including families and children) and forced them to commit mass suicide by drinking cyanide mixed with Kool Aid. In total, more than 900 people were killed, including Jim Jones himself. In other locations, a few others died via murder or murder-suicide. Very few members survived.

In Jonestown, Jim Jones had completely isolated the people inside from the rest of the world. Members did not have access to the news or other opinions so Jim Jones could tell them whatever he wanted (even though it was a lie).

He would force members to do 'White night' rehearsals, where at random, people would be forced to wake up in the early hours of the morning and evacuate their quarters. He always engrained in his members that the CIA or the government were out to get them, and that they would destroy the settlement or kill them all.  

During the Port Kaituma airstrip shootings, multiple important government officials visited Jonestown and took back some of the members. As they were boarding the aircraft to return back home, Jim Jones' men had followed them to the airstrip, and had shot many of them to death. 

This is around the time when Jim Jones gathered around his people and told them to commit 'revolutionary suicide.' He mixed Kool Aid with cyanide and forced them to drink it. 

This has also been referred to by some as a mass-murder, as the people were under the influence of Jim Jone's manipulation. Many of them did not want to (especially children, who were crying as they were forced to drink Kool Aid), and they were surrounded by men holding guns.
