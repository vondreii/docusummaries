### Summary 

Victorian Staircases were one of the most dangerous things in the home in the Victorian/Edwardian times. At the time, the middle had more money to spend, so they started spending in pimping up their homes (including the staircase).

Having a staircase was a sign of wealth and luxury in those times. However staircases were constructed very dangerously. The size of each step was too short (and would not be able to fit a full foot, you would have to twist yourself while walking down). They were also very steep compared to today's staircases. This resulted in many unnecessary deaths due to people falling down the stairs.
