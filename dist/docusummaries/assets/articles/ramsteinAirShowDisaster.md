The team were performing a move called the 'Pierced heart' where the planes 'draw' a heard on the sky. All the planes fly upwards, then about half the planes fly to the right and the other half to the left (forming the top parts of the love heart) before flying down and connecting the love heart again at the bottom. One lone plane leaves to fly separately and is meant to pierce the heart in the very center.

The plane that was meant to pierce the heart came flying in too low, crashing into the other planes when they were meeting at the bottom of the heart. In total, 3 planes collided, 2 of them crashed into the side, and 1 of them catapulted directly into a large crowd of people, killing 70 and injuring almost 350.
