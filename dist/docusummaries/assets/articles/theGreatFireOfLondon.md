The fires are thought to have been started in a Bakery at Pudding Lane in the middle of the night. The houses at the time were wooden and built very close together, so the fire was able to spread very quickly to other houses. 

Englishmen thought that the fire was a terrorist attack started by different groups. Many conspiracies evolved to suggest that the French, Dutch, or any enemy of England at the time may have been responsible. This resulted in lynching, violence and angry mobs, which happened during the days of the fire.

Towards the end of the Great London Fire, the fire was about to reach the Tower of London. This was a facility which stored much gunpowder and explosives. Citizens attempted to put out the fire by pouring water on it, but one man intentionally destroyed his home and used it as a blockage or gap to stop the fire from spreading to other houses. 

Eventually, many houses were pulled down before the fire reached the Tower of London, and it was unable to progress. The fire burnt itself out on the 4th day just before reaching the Tower of London.
