### Summary 

David Reimer, a boy at birth, had a failed circumcision that caused his penis to be removed completely. His parents were worried about David's future stresses, and how he would feel shame to not have one as he grew up. The parents took him to see a psychologist - John Money. John Money thought this would be a good opportunity to run an experiment about gender identity. He wanted to see if it was possible to 'train' or 'raise' someone to be a different gender that what they were assigned at birth. He told David's parents to raise him as a girl by forcing him to wear girls clothes and referring to him as 'her'.

David Reimer had a twin bother, Bruce Reimer. John Money used Bruce as the 'control' for the experiment. David underwent a gender reassignment surgery to be a girl, and he was raised as a girl from an extremely young age. He was also referred to as 'Brenda.'

John Money had psychologist appointments with Bruce and 'Brenda' together. He secretly forced them to re-enact sexual positions while he took photos.

Even though 'Brenda' was treated like a girl, he always felt like a male. He bullied a lot and called 'Cavewoman.' 

When 'Brenda' was 13, he was suicidal and had depression, and threatened to kill himself if he had to see Dr. Money again. His parents told him the truth and David finally did a reverse-gender reassignment and assumed his natural male identity. 

Despite going back to his proper gender, the damage had already been done psychologically since it messed with his early childhood psychological growth. He found it difficult to hold a job and was having relationships difficulties with his wife and parents. Ontop of this, his brother Bruce also committed suicide.

On May 2, 2004, David's wife, Jane, told him that she wanted to separate. On the morning of May 4, 2004, David drove to a carpark of a shopping center in his home town in Winnipeg, and shot himself in the head with a shotgun. He was 38 years old.
